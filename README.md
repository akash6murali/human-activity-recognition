# human-activity-recognition
This project aims to develop a Human Activity Recognition (HAR) system using high-frequency wrist-worn accelerometer data from the CAPTURE-24 dataset. By combining machine learning and deep learning models with sequential smoothing techniques, the system will classify everyday activities such as walking, sitting, or climbing stairs, while ensuring predictions align with expected energy expenditure levels. The motivation for this work lies in the growing demand for reliable activity monitoring solutions that can enhance health, improve safety, and support data-driven decision-making across a range of real-world applications. Our goal is to deliver a robust, generalizable HAR model that can support real-world applications in health, wellness, and safety, while advancing the use of wearable sensor data for human activity monitoring.
